# LocastPlexTuner

## Overview

This is a full port of the https://github.com/tgorgdotcom/locast2plex Python library.

I was having issues with that solution working properly, and have no clue how to efficiently debug Python, so it was just faster to translate it into a language / framework I'm familiar with.


## Terminology

* DMA = Designated Market Area
* EPG = Electronic Programming Guide
